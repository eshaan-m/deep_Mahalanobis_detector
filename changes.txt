Made copies of original files to experiment with generative modelling on Mahalanobis Scores

mahalanobis_gen.py ---> adapted from OOD_Generate_Mahalanobis.py
mahalanobis_ood.py --> adapted from OOD_Regression_Mahalanobis.py
lib_generation_gen.py --> adapted from lib_generation.py
lib_reg_gen.py --> adapted from lib_regression.py
adv_reg_gen.py --> adapted from ADV_Regression.py

added_files :
check_gaussian.py : plot histograms of activations to check their gaussianity
data_dim.py : Dimensionality reduction using Random Projections
get_all_activations.py : Store all the activations, without applying any dimensionality reduction
plot_mahalanobis.py: To fit a GMM to the log() of Mahalanobis scores
